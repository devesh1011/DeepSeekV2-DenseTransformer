# MLA-Based Transformer

This repository implements a transformer model with a focus on **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**, a novel attention mechanism designed to enhance the performance of transformer-based architectures. The project is modular, with components for data preparation, tokenization, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)
Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a custom attention mechanism that extends the traditional multi-head attention by incorporating latent representations. This approach allows the model to capture more nuanced dependencies in the input data, improving its ability to handle complex tasks. The implementation is provided in the `MultiHeadLatentAttention` class within [`attention.py`](attention.py).

### Transformer Architecture
The transformer architecture is the backbone of this project, consisting of modular components such as attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks, and positional encodings. These components are combined into transformer blocks, which are implemented in [`block.py`](block.py). The architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

### Feed-Forward Network
The feed-forward network is a key component of the transformer architecture, responsible for processing the output of the attention mechanism. It is implemented as a modular layer in [`feed_forward_net.py`](feed_forward_net.py), allowing for easy customization and integration into the transformer blocks.

### Tokenization
Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in transformer-based models. This project uses GPT-2 Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, implemented using the `tiktoken` library in [`tokenizer.py`](tokenizer.py). The tokenization process ensures that the input text is converted into a format suitable for the model.

### Data Preparation
The data preparation pipeline is designed to handle raw text data, tokenize it, and split it into training and validation datasets. This process is implemented in [`data_prepare.py`](data_prepare.py), ensuring that the data is ready for model training.

### Model Configuration
The model's architecture and hyperparameters are defined in [`model_config.py`](model_config.py). This configuration file allows users to easily modify parameters such as the number of layers, hidden dimensions, and attention heads, enabling experimentation with different model setups.

### Training and Evaluation
The training pipeline is implemented in [`train.py`](train.py), which handles the training process, including data loading, model optimization, and checkpointing. The evaluation script in [`test.py`](test.py) provides tools for assessing the model's performance on validation data.

## Applications
The MLA-Based Transformer is designed for a variety of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, classification, and sequence-to-sequence tasks. Its modular design and custom attention mechanism make it a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning.
